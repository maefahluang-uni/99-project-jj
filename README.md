# Project -title
Enhancing Access and efficiency in healthcare with a car booking system
Our upcoming app will transform data processing in healthcare logistics. This is different from the existing system which has a delay in data transmission. Our app has been engineered to expedite this process. with our innovation Data processing that used to take days is now completed in hours. It provides fast and smooth access to important transport services for patients and medical staff, among other areas of our future development. We think that this app can be used in other medical centers. We are thinking of improving the system initially from the vehicle used in Mae Fah University Medical Center. Currently there is only 1 car. We may increase the number of cars to meet the needs of more app users.
